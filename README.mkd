# ffi-allegro

## Introduction
`ffi-allegro` is a ruby binding for the allegro graphic library.

## Platform
`ffi-allegro` is developed and tested on Linux with Ruby 1.9 and the latest
Allegro release. If you test it on other platforms, I'll be happy to hear
about it.

## Warning
This binding is in development, and is likely to change without any prior
notification, at least until Allegro stable is released.
